# 阻止 妨礙

hinder      通過延遲的方法加以妨礙   The travelers were hindered by storms throughout their journey
hamper      通過系緊或纏住而妨礙      A suit and an overcoat hampered the efforts of the accident victim to swim to safety. 
impede      通過使活動、行動發生困難而延緩發展      Sentiment and eloquence serve only to impede the pursuit of truth
obstruct     幹擾或阻止前進的障礙的存在     　A building under construction obstructs our view of the mountains
